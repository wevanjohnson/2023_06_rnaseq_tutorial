This is a tutorial for my RNA-seq tutorial taught at Makerere University on June 2023

You will need to install the following:
`if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)){install.packages("BiocManager")}`
`BiocManager::install("Rsubread")`
`BiocManager::install("Rsamtools")`

You may also want to install for downstream analysis: 
`install.packages("devtools")`
`devtools::install_github("wevanjohnson/singleCellTK")`
